# Description
Test task for the competition from HUAWEI.

# Task
Implement in the C programming language parallel program and test to it using one or more technologies.
Two real matrices A and B are given. Calculate the matrix C = A âˆ™ B.

# About the program
The program is written in C using OpenMP.

# Compilation
The program has been successfully compiled and tested with the gcc v9.3.0 compiler on the Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
To compile, you need to use the following command:
gcc -fopenmp main.c -o main

# Launching
To run the program, you need to use the following command (without angle brackets):
./main argument_list

## Arguments
the first argument (without taking into account the program name) is the mode of the program Values:
- file - if the source data should be read from files
- random - if the source data should be generated
        
if the first argument is file
- the second argument is the path to the file with matrix A (see [File format](https://github.com/RoadToPurpose/HUAWEI#File-format))
- the third argument is the path to the file with matrix B (see [File format](https://github.com/RoadToPurpose/HUAWEI#File-format))
- the fourth argument is the number of decimal places when displaying matrices

if the first argument is random
- the second argument is the count of rows in matrix A
- the third argument is the count of cols in matrix A
- the fourth argument is the count of rows in matrix B
- the fifth argument is the count of cols in matrix B
- the sixth argument is the number of decimal places when displaying matrices

## File format
The program uses the following format for input and output files:
- the first row is the number of rows of the matrix
- the second row is the number of cols of the matrix
- Next, there are rows_count rows (each with cols_count elements), which contain the elements of the matrix

### Example:
A matrix that contains 3 rows and 2 columns, with elements 1 2 3 4 5 6, respectively:
```
3
2
1 2
3 4
5 6
```

## Return value
Return value is an error code (an description line is displayed in the console): 
| Error code | Description |
|:-----------:|:---------------------|
| 0 | success |
| 1 | non-existent file |
| 2 | incorrect parameters of the matrix size (for example, if it was indicated that the matrix should have -10 rows) |
| 3 | if matrices do not match in size |
| 4 | incorrect precision value (less than or equal to zero) |
| 5 | wrong number of arguments |
| 6 | invalid argument value |

## Results of the program
The results of the program are output to text files (see [File format](https://github.com/RoadToPurpose/HUAWEI#File-format)). If the random mode is specified, then matrix A is output to the file "matrixA.txt", and matrix B is output to the file "matrixB.txt".
The result of the sequential algorithm is output to the "sequential.txt" file.
The result of the parallel algorithm is output to the "parallel.txt" file.

## Examples
Launching the program with reading initial data from files "A.txt" and "B.txt" and with outputting matrices with precision up to three decimal places:
```
./main file A.txt B.txt 3
```

Launching the program with the generation of initial data (matrix A has a size of 5x10, matrix B has a size of 10x3) and with the output of matrices with an accuracy of four decimal places
```
./main random 5 10 10 3 4
```
